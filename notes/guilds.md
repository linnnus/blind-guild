# Guilds

A guild is analogous to a clan or team in other games.
They do content togeter, i.e. dungeons, raids, etc.

Guilds are an integral part of the game.
Even players who whish to play alone have to join a temporary group
if they want to enter a dungeon.

Players generally have a preferred role (i.e. DPS/tank/healer) within a guild.
They stick to this role when engaging in content with the guild.
This limit is purely cultural;
the game does not actually restrict players to a single role.

## Adding players

Characters belong to guilds.
A single player can have multiple characters that belong to multiple guilds.

Characters either apply to a guild
in which case the application can be accepted at any time,
or they are invited,
in which case they _must_ be online.
