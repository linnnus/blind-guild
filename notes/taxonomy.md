# Taksonomi

This note provides an overview of the general taxonomy of WoW players and their characters.
It does not aim to provide an overview of the entire game,
just the relationship between players, characters, and roles.

## Accounts

At the top of the hierarchy sits the account.
Players generally only have one account.

Accounts have: 

- Account-wide achievements
- Collectables (cosmetic, does not affect gameplay)

Each account is assocaited with one or more characters.

Battle.net accounts work across games.
They can be thought of as analogous to Steam accounts.

## Characters

Characters are the actual avatars that walk around in-game.
A character has a specific race and class.
These generally don't change
(but it is possible with a ca. 20$ race-change).

N.B. A high level account does not affect the level of a newly created character.
It is just as shit as one associated with a low-level account.

## Race

Among the different races are: human, orc, elf, etc.
Races control the appearence of characters
as well as the available classes for that character,
e.g. humans can play all classes except druid, shaman, and demon hunters.

Certain abilities are also coupled to races.

## Classes

Among the different classes are: demon-hunter, munk, priest, paladin, etc.

Certain abilities are limited to one class.
For example, all mages can give a damage buff to their entire party.
This ability is fundamental to all mages, regarless of their chosen specialization.

Characters don't change their class.

## Specializations

Withing a class there are certain specializations.
These vary between classes.
For example, a mage might specialize as either a fire mage, ice mage, or arcange mage.

Specializations belong to different roles: DPS, healer or tank.
This decides what role sthey fill in the game.
For example,
during a raid (boss fight) tanks aim to attract damage to free up other players.

This also means some clases can play as different roles,
because they have different specializations available.
**It is possible to switch between roles.**

The combination of class og specization flavours the role.
There is a big difference between a warlock DPS and a munk DPS
or even a fire mage (DPS) and ice mage (also DPS).
